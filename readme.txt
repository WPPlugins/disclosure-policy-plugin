An interface to manage disclosure, legal and business relationships in both Wordpress posts and RSS feeds

== Description ==

When initially conceived, this plugin was intended to aid bloggers with diverse business relationships to include some form of financial disclosure at the bottom of posts, and in their RSS feeds. But, since that initial conception, it has evolved into an application that has a multitude of uses in a business context, and it might even prove useful for more traditional personal bloggers who might occasionally mention their employer or want a way to automatically link through to related content. 
    Potential Usage:
<ul>
<li>Declaring a financial relationship</li>
<li>Copyright statement</li>
<li>Commercial email statements</li>
<li>Legal disclaimers especially for legal or medical advice</li>
<li>Links through to related content on your website</li>
<li>Related content on a 3rd party website</li>
<li>Advertising</li>
</ul>


== Installation ==
<ol>
<li>Just unzip and upload the folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress</li>
<li>Modify the options in dashboard >>> disclosure policy</li>
</ol>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<ul>
<li><b>Do I need this plugin?</b><br />

If you are not monetizing your site in any way, and are not interested in protecting the copyright of your work, or benefitting from your work being syndicated, then maybe not.</li>
</ul>

There are many simpler solutions available for people who only have a partial need to include copyright text at the bottom of a post in their feeds and I also offer a solution using <a href="http://andybeard.eu/feedburner-feedflare-library">Feedburner Feed Flares</a>
