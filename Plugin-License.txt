License

Up until 5 minutes ago, I was going to license this as something other than GPL, retaining some level of control of the code and its distribution.

It should be noted that none of the code was based upon any prior work, although certain files in the distribution do use certain Wordpress functions.

Also a number of function libraries were used that are detailed below and carry a seperate license.

Lets call this a test of human nature
